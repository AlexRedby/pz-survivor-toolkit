# Reproducible native stands

One preparation/launch/report tool, independent suites, and a fresh profile for every run. No shared mutable save. The product still uses the native `ISTimedActionQueue` executor.

## Files and contributions

- `tools/check_action_queue.py` and `tools/queue_checks/`: shared CLI, snapshots, process lifecycle and reports.
- `support/`: Java launcher, preflight and native fixture placement.
- `<suite>/{client,server,shared}/`: each suite's test-only Lua mod.
- `catalog.json`: case IDs, producers, capabilities, SP/MP and modes. Declarations are not passing tests.
- `contributions/<topic>/`: preserved stands from other chats, pending integration. Intake does not count as runner coverage.

Commit fixtures, parameters, assertions and reproduced limitations. Do not commit game/Workshop copies, compiled JARs/classes, profiles, saves, credentials, logs or videos. Outputs go outside the checkout or in ignored `dist/`. Delivered stands must not import `.codex/investigations` or hardcode a developer's directories.

For a suite, read `QueueTestSelection` for exact kind/mode/cases/port. Emit JSON after `[QUEUE_CHECK] `: one `setup`, one ordered `case` per selected ID, then `complete`. Events name suite/actor/kind/mode. Cases report passed/failed/skipped; skips require reasons. Setup proves the actual feature mode and native durations. Exact effects require authoritative receipts. The first receipt validator is medical; other suites need their own validator before being marked ready.

## Commands

Preparation needs Python 3.11+, JDK 25+ and installed B42.21 game files. Native GUI launch currently supports macOS. The runner needs no Python packages. Health fixture selfchecks use `luajit` on PATH; existing product Lua regressions separately use `lupa`.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_queue_*.py'
python3 tests/native_queue/health/check.py
python3 tools/check_action_queue.py matrix
```

Set local `PZ_GAME` to the directory containing `projectzomboid.jar`, and `PZ_JDK` to a JDK root. Use the same queue-independent selection in both modes:

```sh
python3 tools/check_action_queue.py run /tmp/pz-control-fresh \
  --game "$PZ_GAME" --jdk "$PZ_JDK" --kind mp \
  --mode native --cases nativeStop,remoteRemoved
python3 tools/check_action_queue.py run /tmp/pz-toolkit-fresh \
  --game "$PZ_GAME" --jdk "$PZ_JDK" --kind mp \
  --mode toolkit --cases nativeStop,remoteRemoved --control /tmp/pz-control-fresh
```

The default suite is health and default mod set is only `PZSurvivorToolkit`. Use `--mods selected --workshop /path/to/workshop/content/108600` for the project INI; repeat `--workshop` for other explicit installed roots. Missing/ambiguous Mod IDs fail. Required Java patch artifacts must already be built using `tools/prepare_install.py`.

A comparable control uses the same game/source/mod bytes/cases/languages/ports/settings; only queue mode changes. MP uses two actual clients with reversed doctor/patient roles. EN `remoteRemoved` explicitly skips treatment to keep the actual peer connected; RU performs the real disconnect. Toolkit-only controls skip with reasons in native mode.

Native-mode success means that the fixture observed and verified native behavior, not that native queues preserve later work. For `remoteRemoved`, a started native treatment can stall after the patient leaves. After 60 seconds, the fixture verifies the exact owned action and original books/supply, records `nativeStallObserved=true` and `queueDrained=false`, then stops that action for fixture cleanup. It still checks exact clinical/resource effects. Toolkit mode requires normal completion and the fully read tail, with no such cleanup workaround.

Use `prepare` instead of `run` to inspect inputs before launch, then `resume /tmp/the-fresh-profile`. Use `report /tmp/the-run --control /tmp/the-control` to audit without launch. `matrix /tmp/the-run/report.json --output /tmp/coverage.json` displays actual actor evidence, including missing/skipped cells. Results describe their recorded source snapshot, not every future revision.

Matrix cells describe functional coverage; consult the same run's separate runtime/overall verdict before accepting a release. `not-migrated` means an older stand has not joined this runner, not that the corresponding product feature is absent. Prepared files in cache `Lua/` are pinned; new native-generated layout/options files there are outputs. Added/removed code under `mods/` or `classes/` is rejected. Timestamped DebugLog and console copies are normalized for mirror counting while their source locations remain in the report.

## Result and isolation

Each run keeps input/source/mod manifests, original settings and individual launch/console/DebugLogs. `execution.json` records owned processes; `report.json`, `report.txt` and `coverage.json` combine scenario outcomes, receipts, source integrity and full log audit. Mirrored logs use maximum occurrence counts per role, not a sum.

Exit 0: checks passed and runtime is clean or errors reproduced in a compatible native control. Exit 1: failure/incomplete execution or changed inputs. Exit 2: review needed for unclassified/new errors or incompatible control. Shared native errors remain visible; a difference alone does not establish the culprit. Functional, runtime and coverage statuses stay separate.

Coordinate the desktop slot before launch. The runner holds `/tmp/pz-queue-native-launch.lock` (same as `/private/tmp/...` on macOS), rejects existing game processes, sets client/server VOIP off and passes `-novoip`. Never bypass it for concurrent GUI stands. Timeout/interruption stop only processes created by that invocation.

Current live fixtures call actual menu/drop callbacks with prepared wounds, supplies and reading progress. Physical mouse input, natural long-session state, WAN latency and all third-party combinations remain separate coverage.

The minimal MP disconnect smoke can report a late native `BodyDamageUpdatePacket` NPE after the patient disappears. A functional pass does not clear that runtime error: if it is absent from the matching control, the result remains `needs-review`/`new-errors`. Investigate its timing and native packet handling before attributing it to queue behavior; the larger selected-mod baseline is still a separate gate.
